Conversation of Roomba Discovery mainboard to Arduino Mega


This page is created for Roomba Discovery to Arduino conversation project. Story began with my roomba discovery failure, mainboard was defected than i have decided to remove mainboard and using Arduino Mega instead of it.

Essential sensors are used with arduino mega and new sketch is written with Roomba algorithm.

If you want to contribute this project please send an e-mail !

Completed Features;

-Wheel encoders, bump sensors, user interface (buttons and leds) used.
-Random bouncing algorithm and wall following algorithm. Robot start with clean mode and count the bumps, when bumps reached 20 it start wall following algorithm about 60 seconds.

Feature ideas;

- Roomba melodies with speaker
- Escape algorithm when stucked
- Auto chargergins as original roomba
- Virtural Walls
- IR Remote Control / Bluetooth / ESP8266
